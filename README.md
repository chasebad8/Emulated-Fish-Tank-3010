The Strawberi E-Tank is a semi-autonomous pet terrarium!  

With the E-Tank you can feed, and monitor your pet at any given time from any location!

We see the target audience as commercial businesses such as Petsmart.  Instead of having employees constantly monitor and feed the animals, the can task one person with updating the Computer software occasionally.  If someone is not able to reach the Computer interface, there is a dedicated android app that has all the same functionality and can be used from anywhere!
Another application where this is useful it on an airplane.  Flight passengers can fly with ease knowing that they can monitor and feed their pets at any time throughout the flight!
